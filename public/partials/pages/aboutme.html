  	<h2>About</h2>
  	<p>My name is Deni Karuli, I'm 26 years old and currently in my senior year at UCF. I will be completing my Computer Science degree this Fall (2016). I was originally born in Albania, my family and I moved to the US in 1995. I grew up in Clearwater, FL and graduated from Countryside High School. In 2009, I became the first person in my family to attend any form of higher education by attending the University of Central Florida. Originally I was studying Biology until 2012 when I finally decided that software engineering was my true passion and switched my major to Computer Science. As long as I can remember Iâ€™ve had a passion for logical thinking, computers, and programming. Throughout the years I have begun to hone my skills in mobile and web development. This particular field is quickly evolving and very competitive. The visual results of mobile and web development make it easy to see the art that your crafting and the competitive nature of the field provides the necessary motivation to continually learn and self improve. Computer Science is more than a job or degree for me, it is a passion of mine that I believe I was meant to do. </p>
